<h2>A Lightweight Yacc for C</h2>

<p>This single-file program implements a useful subset of <a
href="http://www.unix.com/man-page/POSIX/1posix/yacc/">POSIX
yacc</a>.  It lets you describe a language with an unambiguous LALR(1)
grammar and compiles it into a fast C parser for that language.
Because it is so simple, you can use it to learn about parser
generation.  You can also use it to quickly bootstrap a yacc for
another language.  Finally, because it is standalone and under
MIT/X license, you can integrate it very easily in your programs.

<ul>
<li>Get a working version of <a href="data/yacc.c">yacc.c</a>. <br/>
  Compilation is as simple as <code>cc yacc.c -o yacc</code>.
<li>Read the <a href="data/LICENSE">MIT/X license</a>.
<lI>You can <a href="/git/miniyacc.git">browse</a> the source. <br/>
  Or check it out at <code>git://c9x.me/miniyacc.git</code>.
</ul>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Here is a complete minimal example to get started.  You can
compile it using <code>yacc xmpl.y && cc y.tab.c</code>.
Then use the input "2*(3+4*3+1)" to test it, for example.
<pre>
%{
	#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
	int yylex(void);
%}
%token INT
%left '+'
%left '*'
%%
prog: expr          { printf("-&gt; %d\n", $1); } ;
expr: INT
    | '(' expr ')'  { $$ = $2; }
    | expr '+' expr { $$ = $1 + $3; }
    | expr '*' expr { $$ = $1 * $3; } ;
%%
int yylex() {    /* crude lexer */
	int c = getchar();
	if (c &gt;= '0' && c &lt;= '9') {
		yylval = c-'0';
		return INT;
	}
	return c == EOF ? 0 : c;
}
int main() { return yyparse(); }
</pre>

<h3>Features</h3>

<ul>
<li>Short and hacker-friendly C89 implementation.
<li>Mostly POSIX (-b, -d, and -v are supported).
<li>Standalone (the skeleton code is in the source).
<li>Generated tables are as efficient as GNU bison's.
<li>Reasonably fast implementation (&lt;1s for 500+ grammar rules).
<li>Supports <code>#line</code> directives.
</ul>

<p>The two main features lacking to make it fully POSIX compliant are
error recovery and mid-action rules (although these can be emulated by
adding a few extra non-terminals with an empty production).  Negative
references into the parsing stack are also unsupported.

<h3>Hacker's Guide</h3>

<p>Yacc is a complex program, to understand it one must first understand
the basics of shift-reduce parsers and get a high level idea of how LR
state generation goes.  I cannot cover these topics here because I know
I will make a poor job at it.  The Dragon Book has excellent coverage for
them and the first edition (which is more than enough) can be found for a
couple of dollars on Amazon (I bought one there and I'm extremely happy
with it).  If you contact me in person, I can provide additional documentation.
In the sequel I will assume that you are a bit familiar with the terminology.

<p>My implementation is divided into four parts, the first one deals
with straightforward inference of properties on the grammar (is a non-terminal
nullable, what is its FIRST set); the second part implements the primitve
operations GOTO and CLOSURE on sets of LALR(1) items together with the 
state generation; the third part figures out the final parsing tables and
compresses them; finally the last part and also the simplest deals with
all the .y parsing and the .c/.h printing.

<p>With loose discipline, I prefixed most functions of the first three parts
with respectively, <code>g</code>, <code>i</code> and <code>tbl</code>.  Also,
the order in which I listed the parts is the order in which you will find
them in the source.  This gives you a basic way to navigate the code.  What
follows is a high level description of every important function and type.

<table>

<tr>
<td>Sym
<td>A symbol, if it is smaller than MaxTk it is a token,
otherwise it is a non-terminal.  No real symbol can be the
special symbol S, we use it to mark the end of a string
of symbols.

<tr>
<td>Rule
<td>A grammar rule, the lhs field is an array of symbols
terminated by the special symbol S.  The action field
stores the semantic action given in the .y file for
this rule.

<tr>
<td>Item
<td>A LALR(1) state, i.e. a set of Term.
The set is stored in an array which is structured as
follows.  Elements of the <em>core</em> (which have
their dot not at the very beginning) come first, and
they are sorted according to the icmp order.
Then follows a bunch of items not in the core, they 
can be in any order but need to be grouped by lhs.
Here is an example item
<pre>
E -&gt; E . O E
O -&gt; . A
A -&gt; . '+'
A -&gt; . '-'
</pre>

<tr>
<td>rfind
<td>Returns a pointer to the first Rule with a given
left-hand-side.  We use the fact that the rs array is
sorted by lhs.

<tr>
<td>first
<td>Computes the set F of initial tokens that can be
generated by the given sentence terminated by with element
of the last set and union the set passed as first argument
with F.

<tr>
<td>ginit
<td>For every non-terminal N, it computes if N is nullable
or not and the set FIRST(N) and stores it in the is symbol
information array.

<tr>
<td>iclose
<td>Computes the closure of a LALR(1) state.  We basically
follow the textbook procedure.  Note that we make use
of the fact that non-core items are grouped by lhs while
filling and using the smap array.

<tr>
<td>igoto
<td>Computes the GOTO along a given symbol of a LALR(1)
state.

<tr>
<td>icmp
<td>Is non-trivial because it relies on the fact two
elements can be compared by only comparing their core.
You can see the Dragon Book to understand why (or just
think about it).

<tr>
<td>stadd
<td>Is the main workhorse of the state generation routine.
It figures out if a state to-be-inserted is already present
in the state array (kept sorted using the icmp order)
and adds it if not present.  An integer is returned to
signal if a change occured in the state list or not.

<tr>
<td>stgen
<td>The actual state generation function, here also, we
follow the textbook procedure.  We use the modified bit
returned by stadd to figure out if more work has to be
done or not.  There is a simple optimization that sticks
a dirty bit to every state to know if it is necessary to
recompute the GOTOs from this state or not.

<tr>
<td>resolve
<td>Resolves shift/reduce conflicts using precedence
and associativity of tokens and rules.  The procedure
implemented is described in details by POSIX.

<tr>
<td>tblset
<td>Compute the action generated by one Term in a LALR(1)
state, it can be a shift or a reduce depending on the
position of the dot.  This function figures out if the
grammar has conflicts or not.

<tr>
<td>setdef
<td>Given a table row, this function figures out the most
frequent entry and stores it as default.  It is used to
get a very sparse table (compact to store).  The rows it
processes are rows from the action and goto tables.  On an
action row, it is very often (if not always) that there
is only one reduce entry, we use it as default.  The goto
table, if stored with indexing [state][nonterm] always
have entries that are all different (see Dragon Book),
to make good use of the default table one must store it
with indexing [nonterm][state].  To convince yourself
that it is a good idea, your can run yacc.c on a sample
grammar with the -v option and check the y.output file.

<tr>
<td>tblgen
<td>Generate the action and goto tables and compute and
store their most frequent entry per row.  The indexing
for the goto table is [nonterm][state], and for
the action table it is [state][token].  These different
indexing schemes permit to have smaller tables.

<tr>
<td>actgen
<td>The supperficial logic is simple, but as a comment
warns, there is a tricky invariant.  This invariant has to
deal with the way the <em>check</em> table is generated.
I will give more details below on how the tables are stored
and why we must be careful when generating them.

<tr>
<td>tblout
<td>Dumps the tables using C syntax.

<tr>
<td>nexttk cpycode gettype getdecls getgram
<td>Vogon poetry for parsing.

<tr>
<td>actout
<td>Output the code for one action and substitutes the $$
and friends with regular C code.  This is a little complex
because we have to do what POSIX calls "type inference",
that is, find out what is the union field to use for each
of the non-terminals referenced in an action.

<tr>
<td>codeout code0 code1
<td>Data and simple code to output the final C file.
Originally, Yacc was using intermediate files for this
generation (POSIX even mentions them).  Considering how
much memory today's computer have, I did not bother with
that and just stored everything in RAM.

</table>
</div>

<p>A Yacc program is expected to generate two main tables: the goto
table and the action table.  In practice, one needs to generate
a few more.  Here is a description of all the tables generated by
the yacc.c program.

<ol>
<li><code>yytrns</code> POSIX requires that 'c' for every c is a 
  valid token, we use this table to map tokens given by yylex
  to a smaller range (this makes the tables more compact).
<li><code>yyr1</code> maps a rule number to the arity (number
  of elements in the lhs) of this rule.
<li><code>yyr2</code> maps a rule number to the lhs symbol
  of this rule.
<li><code>yyadef</code> maps a state to the default reduce for
  this state, or -1 if the state cannot reduce.
<li><code>yygdef</code> maps a non-terminal to its most
  frequent GOTO destination. (Remember that the gotos are
  indexed [nonterm][state].)
<li><code>yyadsp</code> maps states to displacements for actions.
<li><code>yygdsp</code> maps non-terminals to displacements for gotos.
<li><code>yyact</code> contains actions and gotos, this is the
  most important table together with the next one.
<li><code>yychk</code> is the checking table for
  <code>yyact</code>.
</ol>

<p>The scheme used to store tables in a space-efficient manner uses
what we call a row displacement table.  The idea is described very
well in Robert Tarjan's paper <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=359175">
Storing a sparse table</a>, it is also described in section 3.9 of
the Dragon Book.  I will try to sum it up in a few words.  Assume
we want to store efficiently a table A with many zeroes inside,
we also would like that the access in the compacted table is in
constant time.  To do this, we linearize the table A into a simple array
and overlap the different rows of A to make sure very few zeroes are left.
Each original row of A will be assigned a <em>displacement</em> into the
linear array.  The following figure shows an example of this packing process
on a sample table, the r{n} number is the displacement of the original
row n. Stars in the A table represent non-zero entries. 

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img style="max-width: 100%" src="disp.png" alt="Displacement Table Figure">
</div>

<p>The above figure does not show the table T that stores all the non-zero
entries, instead it shows the <em>checking table</em> C.  Using the
displacements r{n}, it is easy to construct T.  The table C is used for
retrieval of data: to get the entry A[n][m] (if n and m are 1-indexed)
we use the algorithm below.

<pre>
x := r{n} + m
if (x &lt;= 0) || (x &gt; size of C) || (C[x] != (n-1)*5 + m-1) then
    return 0
else
    return T[x]
fi
</pre>

<p>Notice how the C table holds the cell number of the corresponding entry stored
in the A table.  It is also sufficient to make C store only the row number
of the entry stored in A, this makes the numbers stored in C smaller and can
help save a few bytes.  This is what we do for the goto table:  the checking
table <code>yychk</code> stores only non-terminal numbers for validation. 
You can see how they are checked in <code>code0</code>, the skeleton code
for C files generation.

<p>The case of the action table is a bit trickier.  One
can easily observe that many rows in an action table are often identical,
so we would like to assign these rows the same displacement.  This is possible
but what is stored in the checking table needs to be changed.  Indeed, the
whole point of the checking table is that no two entries of A can be validated
at the same location in T.  One way to make this compression possible is to
store the <em>column</em> number in the checking table instead of the row
number.  This way, two same rows can be assigned the same displacement and
will both be correctly validated by the checking table.  This explains why
the <code>yychk</code> table checks action entries based on token number
(and not on state number).

<p>We can now discuss the way to find the displacements r{n} used above.
There is a fairly straightforward greedy algorithm that works well for
that (it is explained in Tarjan's paper why).  We simply sort the rows
by decreasing number of non-zero entries and greedily assign the first-fit
displacements for all the rows.  This explains why there are <code>qsort</code>
calls in the <code>actgen</code> function.  You can check that the
displacements for A above were generated with this technique.  This is
all nice and simple, but when we play the trick explained in the previous
paragraph we have to be a bit careful.  The risk is that a naive implementation
of the algorithm described here could assign the same displacement to
the two following rows.

<pre>
Colmns   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
-------+-------------------+
       ...
Row n  | 0 0 3 0 4 0 0 0 6 |
       ...
Row m  | 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 6 |
</pre>

<p>Row m is "included" in row n, a naive implementation could give them
the same displacement, but then, when querying the entry [m][5], one
would get 4 as an answer (becasue the checking table would validate the
column 5 for row n) and not 0!  This is a potential source of nasty bugs.
The lesson is that rows must be assigned the same displacement if and only
if they are exactly the same.  The loop in <code>actgen</code> makes sure
it is the case by relying on the fact that entries are supplied in
decreasing number of non-zero entries.  This is probably the trickiest part
of table generation (and it is also a performance hog), I would be happy
to take your suggestions about that.

<p>I want to conclude these remarks on table generation/compression by
saying that if this remains opaque for you, the best we to understand it
is to use a very small grammar (infix addition and multiplication for
example), run it through yacc.c with the -v option and decypher the
code generated using the y.output file, a pen, and some paper.  You might
even discover a bug that way!
